[ BOT SET UP + COMMANDS ]

► Hello Summoner, you found the readme file - congratulations!
Anarchy can be used not only to level accounts but also to decrease MMR in normals and ranked on summoners rift (also known as deranking!)
Unlike most bots, Anarchy functions differently and clings to a human player to participate in the game, it will not move on its own nor make own decisions. This leads
to less pattern-like behavior but a rather unpredictable bot that is very sticky but tries its best to support the (human) player it sticks to.

► (WINDOWS-KEY)+(K) will bring up a little popup window that displays the bot's current stats/information, after closing the window the bot will continue (acts as a pause)
► (ALT)+(O) will stop the bot
► Holding (i) ingame will cause the bot to stop playing after the game ends.

► As soon as you start it, the bot takes the wheel and will start playing just like a human would, it clicks on things in the client etc...
  Please do not move the mouse or use the keyboard while it is playing, pause the bot first and close the pause-window to resume.

► Yuumi is the best champion for deranking as it is hard to spot that it is infact a bot.




[ INSTALLATION ]
Tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2XSlQ0QchQ

► Install Autohotkey (from autohotkey.com, official and trustworthy source, take "Current Version")

Windows Settings (IMPORTANT!!!)
Cleartext is enabled and all pre-selected options are taken (clicking "Next" each option)?
No external color settings applied? (NVidia for example)

Navigate to System settings and go to "Display" ► Set scale of Text, Apps and other Elements to 100% (default), Screen resolution should be 1920x1080!

► After extracting all of the files from the downloaded Anarchy.zip, the bot itself is set up!
► Configure the bot by double clicking the _Anarchy.ahk file and hitting "Apply settings" after selecting the settings you want.
► Client language MUST BE ENGLISH!!!
► Set your League client size to 1280x720
► Start the _Test-Dummy.ahk file, applying the settings and enter a 5v5 custom game with 9 other bots. After clicking "Start Playing" the bot should start to play.

The bot doesn't play?
Apply all the settings either in the _Test-Dummy GUI or _Anarchy GUI, make sure you know where your League of Legends is installed and hit "change folder" to let the bot
know where to apply its ingame settings. The League Game-Window should be 160x90 pixels in size (incredibly small).
Go into a lobby and compare sampleimage.png to your client, do they look the same?

The bot plays?
Exit the custom game, you only need to start the _Anarchy.ahk file now, League of Legends does not need to be open to start, the bot closes all instances of it anyways.


[ BOT CONFIGURATION - CONFIG.INI]

► Click the _Anarchy.ahk file to open the config GUI OR Open the config.ini file.


[section1]
username1 ► Here you enter the username which the bot uses in the RIOT CLIENT to log into the account.
password1 ► Here you enter a password that matches with username1 to log into an account.
username2 ► See the above ↑
password2 ► See the above ↑
accountCount ► This stays at 2 unless you modify the bot, to add more accounts simply add "username3=", "password3=" and set accountCount=3 (add as many as you want),
	       the bot rotates through them in order, only one account will be in use at a time.
azerty ► If you use the bot on a machine that has an AZERTY (French) keyboard layout instead of a QWERTY/QWERTZ keyboard, set this option to 1 or check it in the GUI!


[section2]
Yuumi ► enter 0 (= No) or 1 (= Yes), this tells the bot that it can pick Yuumi on all accounts (= The account(s) own this champion).
Teemo ► enter 0 (= No) or 1 (= Yes), this tells the bot that it can pick Teemo on all accounts (= The account(s) own this champion).
Taric ► enter 0 (= No) or 1 (= Yes), this tells the bot that it can pick Taric on all accounts (= The account(s) own this champion).
Sona ► enter 0 (= No) or 1 (= Yes), this tells the bot that it can pick Sona on all accounts (= The account(s) own this champion).
Soraka ► enter 0 (= No) or 1 (= Yes), this tells the bot that it can pick Sona on all accounts (= The account(s) own this champion).


[section3]
gamemode ► 1 (Ranked Solo/Duo), 2 (Ranked Flex), 3 (Normal Blindpick), 4 (Intro Bots)


[section4]
mode ► (here you can limit the time the bot plays daily/per account) enter either 1 or 2, 1 means that the bot will take "starttime" and "stoptime" into account when considering
       to play another game. 2 Means that the bot will play for the amount of time entered under "timeperaccountinminutes".
timeperaccountinminutes ► ONLY IMPORTANT IF MODE IS 2, enter a number here which will tell the bot how much time it can play on each account before switching to the other acc.
sleeptimeafterswitch ► Amount of time (in minutes) the bot will sleep after being done playing on one account.
sleeptimebetweenmatch ► Amount of time (in minutes) the bot will sleep after finishing a game of League of Legends.
starttime ► ONLY IMPORTANT IF MODE IS 1, enter a daytime (FORMAT: HHMMSS, H=Hours, M=Minutes, S=Seconds ► 8am = 080000)
stoptime ► ONLY IMPORTANT IF MODE IS 1, enter a daytime (FORMAT: HHMMSS, H=Hours, M=Minutes, S=Seconds ► 8:30pm = 163000)

The bot will be allowed to play in the timespan which is between starttime and stoptime (local time! This span can go beyond the date limit or 0:00;
for example startime = 230000 (23:00, 11pm) and stoptime = 090000 (09:00, 9am) and after 09:00 has passed, it will sleep until 23:00 and then play on the other account)

inting ► The bot runs down mid (only do this in bot games).
randomsummoners ► Enter 0 (= no) or 1 (= yes); Tells the bot to pick random summoner spells every game.
randomrunes ► Enter 0 (= no) or 1 (= yes); Tells the bot to pick a random rune page every game.
randomchat ► Enter 0 (= no) or 1 (= yes); Tells the bot to send random chat messages before, during and after the game (messages can be edited in chat.ini)
buffergames ► Enter 0 (= no) or 1 (= yes); IMPORTANT SETTING!!! Tells the bot to play 2-5 games of the mode set in [section3],
	      the bot will switch to intro bot games and play 2-5 games there, then switch back to the original gamemode. This really helps against troll/inting bans (ranked).
prioritypick ► Enter one champion name from [section2] in lowercase letters (e.g.: yuumi); Tells the bot to always pick that champion if it is available.




[ BOT CONFIGURATION - CHAT.INI, ONLY RELEVANT IF "RANDOM CHAT MESSAGES" ARE ENABLED! ]

Open the chat.ini file.
There are indexes (1,2,3..) and messages in the file, divided into 3 sections.

Section1 ► Messages to be sent in champ select.
Section3 ► Messages to be sent while ingame.
Section5 ► Messages to be sent in the post game lobby.

You may add or modify the messages as you like, to add additional messages (let's say there is 10 messages already in section5) do this:

11=GG EZ
12=Next time, we win!
13=...

[ TROUBLESHOOTING ]

► If the target ally (which the bot follows all game except when that ally is dead) goes afk,
  the bot will stay on that ally and will get leaverbuster but it can deal with leaverbuster popups in the client and continue running.
► DO NOT ENTER NEGATIVE NUMBERS IN THE CONFIG.INI FILE OR GUI.
► Test if the League shortcut file in this folder works, if it does not work, navigate to your League of Legends installation folder, create a shortcut of LeagueClient.exe
  and put it into the bot's folder, named "shortcut".
► The League client is a buggy mess and sometimes the bot will fail to navigate it, this can lead to queue lockout timers in rare scenarios if the client lags out.
► Visit our Website for more information. https://anarchybot.wixsite.com/info
► Subscribe to the Official Youtube Channel for updates and guides! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCb948ycty7cDeFO8xnCvZrQ
► If the shortcut doesn't work run League of Legends manually via the Riot Client, log into an account and exit. Now go to C:\Riot Games\League of Legends and
  make a shortcut using the LeagueClient.exe file. Rename this file to "shortcut" and paste it into the bot's folder.
► It is a known issue of the League Client to get stuck on low-end machines.
